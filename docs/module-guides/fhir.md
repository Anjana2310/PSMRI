## Overview

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard defines how healthcare information can be exchanged between different computer systems regardless of how it is stored in those systems. FHIR provides a means for representing and sharing information among clinicians and organizations in a standard way regardless of the ways local EHRs represent or store the data. FHIR combines the best features of previous standards into a common specification, while being flexible enough to meet needs of a wide variety of use cases within the healthcare ecosystem.
Resources are the basis for all exchangeable FHIR content. Each resource includes a standard definition and human-readable descriptions about how to use the resource. Each resource also has a set of common and resource-specific metadata (attributes) to allow its use clearly and unambiguously. FHIR Resources can store and/or exchange many types of clinical and administrative data.
For FHIR in AMRIT, currently we have developed 9 resources out of 27 resources. Wipro along with Google are developing rest of the 18 resources which will make AMRIT to be compliant with ABDM guidelines.
FHIR R4 is the latest version which we are migrating from HL7 V2.0 current version of AMRIT application
